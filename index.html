Understanding issues relating to DIB, especially in regards to representation in technology, is necessary for informed and effective policy-making. Displaying historical and present-day demographic breakdowns within concentrations and schools can be useful for identifying trends and making sense of the current situation.</i></div>

						<h2>SEAS: Historical Context</h2>
					</div>
				</div>
				<div class="row">
					<div class="col-md-8" id="historical-context">
						Harvard University has a long and noteworthy STEM history. From countless science Nobel Prizes to the Mark I computer first programmed by Lieutenant Grace Hopper among others, Harvard’s history is filled with major STEM contributions.
						<br/><br/>
						The following highlights from the timeline on the SEAS website give an overview of SEAS’ development since it was founded in 1847 as Harvard’s Lawrence Scientific School:
						<ul>
							<li>1901: Pierce Hall opened as the “home of applied physics and mathematics research and teaching at Harvard”</li>
							<li>1906: Lawrence Scientific School is disbanded and merges into university</li>
							<li>1919: Harvard reestablishes a “scientific school”, the Harvard Engineering School</li>
							<li>1947: Harvard opens the nation’s first master’s program in computer science</li>
							<li>1949: The Harvard Engineering School is reorganized and demoted from a full school at Harvard to a division within the Faculty of Arts and Sciences</li>
							<li>2007: Harvard elevates the Division of Engineering and Applied Sciences to become a full-fledged school, the School of Engineering and Applied Sciences (SEAS)</li>
							<li>2015: Harvard Business School alumnus John Paulson donated $400 million to SEAS, the largest gift ever received by Harvard. SEAS is renamed the Harvard John A. Paulson School of Engineering and Applied Sciences in his honor</li>
						</ul>
						However, even while engineering and applied sciences have been very significant to Harvard’s history for a long time, the issue of diversity, inclusion, and belonging continues to be present despite SEAS’ growing influence on Harvard’s campus.

						As we’ve seen, interest and participation in SEAS has grown significantly at Harvard over the past decade. SEAS has adopted for this growth by hiring 50 new faculty members and building a host of new facilities.
						In the coming years, the size of the SEAS community is projected to continue to grow, and Harvard is planning a significant expansion of the campus that will include state-of-the-art teaching and research facilities for SEAS. The 500,000+ square foot Science and Engineering Complex located in Allson plans to open in Fall 2020.
